# lean-polyhedral-geometry

Our goal is to formalize in Lean some basic results in polyhedral geometry, including the equivalence of definitions of a polyhedron in terms of halfspaces and convex hulls.  This project is associated with the Washington Experimental Mathematics Lab at the University of Washington.
